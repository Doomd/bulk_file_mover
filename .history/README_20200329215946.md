## Move Bulk Files from a List (Shell Script)

### Introduction
This is a very basic MacOS/UNIX/LINUX shell script that will move a long list of files from one a collection of locations to another location, maintining the existing folder/tree structure of your files. I made this script because I had to move over 100K image files that have identical filenames in a dozen different folders (ie, `images/filename.jpg, images/thumbnail/filename.jpg, images/large/filename.jpg` etc) that were linked to drupal articles dating before a certain date. One of my clients was tired of copyright trolls suing him for images he thought were "creative commons" and basically decided to move/delete all potentially copyright infringing images from his server until he could ensure each image was copyright free. Anyway, this script assumes you already were able to generate a list of files that you want to move, and assumes you also have a list of folders these files might reside in.

**If you're interested:** *I generated my list of files with an SQL Query and cleaned it up in a Google Spreadsheet. I'll try to create a Readme for this process in the very near future.*

### Files & Folders Explaination
1. There are 3 files you need to be concerned with:
   - `move.sh` : The main very simple script file.
   - `path_list.txt` : A line seperated list of filenames
   - `file_list.txt` : A line seprated list of paths to include
1. The two default folders are:
   - `source_files` : Where your original files are. I've included some public domain images in this folder as an example.
   - `archive` : Where you'd like to move your folder structure and files to.

### Instructions
1. Download or Clone this repository and navigate to it with a new terminal window
2. Ensure you have the correct permissions to run the shell script:
```
$ chmod +x move.sh
```
3. Edit the move.sh script if you want to change your destination folder. It defaults to `destPath="archive"`
4. The script will search through all the directories that are listed in `path_list.txt` and move all matching filenames that are listed in `file_list.txt` into a new folder (in the default case, it's called `archive`). If you'd like to run a test to see it work before you start editing the text files to include your own list of files and paths, go ahead:
```
$ bash move.sh
    or...
$ zsh move.sh
```
5. To have the script search through your own folder tree for your own files, edit the `path_list.txt` file with a list of directory paths you want to move files from. Don't include a trailing backslash:
(ie, `source_files/thumbnails` is good.
`source_files/thumbnails/` IS BAD.
Put a new path on each line. Leave an empty line on the last line.
6. Insert a list of all the filenames you'd like to move into `file_list.txt` ensuring that there is only one filename on each line. The script should work if the filenames include spaces or most special characters, but I didn't do thorough testing, so probably don't include weird things in your file names to be safe. Leave an empty line on the last line.

That's basically it. Run the script again, and all the files you WANT to move will be moved to your destination directory with the existing structure maintained, and all the files NOT included in your file_list.txt will be safely left in place.

Cheers!
